    <section id="About"><h2>About Me</h2><br>
      <p>Hi, I'm Manikanta from 3rd-year B.Tech student at Vignan University. I am passionate about technology, coding, and constantly learning new skills.<br> My journey in engineering has been an exciting one, filled with challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. </p>
      <li>Academic Pursuits:
        As a third-year B.Tech student at Vignan University, I find myself immersed in a dynamic learning environment. The journey has been both exhilarating and challenging‚Äîfilled with late-night coding sessions, collaborative projects, and the thrill of solving complex problems. Each semester brings new subjects, from algorithms and data structures to software engineering and database management. I‚Äôve learned to balance coursework, labs, and exams while nurturing my curiosity for emerging technologies.</li>
      <li>Passion for Technology and Coding:
        Technology isn‚Äôt just a field of study for me; it‚Äôs a way of life. I eagerly devour articles on AI advancements, attend webinars on blockchain, and experiment with Python libraries. Whether it‚Äôs building a responsive website or optimizing an algorithm, I revel in the creative process. Coding, to me, is like composing music‚Äîa symphony of logic, syntax, and innovation.</li>
      <li>      Hobbies for Balance:
        Amid the whirlwind of academics, I‚Äôve discovered the importance of balance. Badminton‚Äîthe rhythmic thwack of the shuttlecock against the racquet‚Äîbecomes my escape. On the court, I shed the complexities of code and immerse myself in the simplicity of movement. And then there are books‚Äîthe silent mentors that expand my horizons. From classic literature to tech blogs, I devour words like a hungry mind. These hobbies recharge me, reminding me that life extends beyond the screen.</li>
      <li>
        Wanderlust and Fresh Perspectives:
        Traveling is my passport to inspiration. Whether it‚Äôs exploring the ancient temples of Hampi or navigating the bustling streets of Hyderabad, each journey unveils a new chapter. I‚Äôve stood in awe before the Charminar, marveled at the symmetry of Golconda Fort, and tasted the spiciest biryani in the bylanes of Old City. Travel fuels my creativity, offering fresh perspectives that infuse my code with cultural nuances.</li>
      <li>  Eager for Impactful Work:
        As I step into the professional world, I carry this eagerness. I want my code to impact lives‚Äîto streamline processes, connect communities, or enhance user experiences. Whether it‚Äôs a startup project or contributing to open-source software, I‚Äôm all in. The thrill lies not only in solving technical puzzles but also in knowing that my lines of code can make someone‚Äôs life easier.</li>
      
      

    
        <li> Collaboration and Creativity:
            Let‚Äôs connect! Collaboration amplifies creativity. Whether it‚Äôs a hackathon team brainstorming solutions or a GitHub repository where developers worldwide contribute, I believe in the power of collective intelligence. Together, we can create something amazing‚Äîa web app that simplifies daily tasks, an algorithm that predicts stock trends, or a platform that fosters learning.</li>

            <h3>Hybrid Intelligence for Enhanced Threat detection in surveillance Footage</h3>
            <p>Brief description of the project: AI surveillance presents a delicate balance between security and privacy. Here are some key concerns:

                Privacy: As AI systems monitor individuals, questions arise about the right to privacy. How much surveillance is acceptable without infringing on personal space? Striking this balance is crucial to avoid undue intrusion.
                Consent: Transparency and informed consent are essential. Individuals should know when they are being surveilled and for what purpose. Lack of consent can lead to ethical violations.
                Bias and Discrimination: AI surveillance systems, like any other AI applications, can inherit biases from training data. If biased data leads to discriminatory outcomes (e.g., unfairly targeting specific demographics), it becomes an ethical issue.
                Potential Abuse: While surveillance enhances security, it can also be misused. Governments, corporations, or malicious actors might exploit AI surveillance for control, manipulation, or suppression.</p>

            <h3>Invest Value Forcasting</h3>
            <p>Brief description of the project:In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving security landscape, effective threat detection is paramount. Surveillance systems play a crucial role in safeguarding public spaces, critical infrastructure, and private establishments. The project aims to enhance threat detection capabilities by combining human expertise with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques‚Äîa synergy known as ‚ÄúHybrid Intelligence.‚Äù
                    <br>
                Objectives
                Real-Time Threat Detection:
                Develop an intelligent surveillance system capable of analyzing live video feeds in real time.
                Detect and classify potential threats such as unauthorized access, suspicious behavior, or dangerous objects.
                Hybrid Intelligence Approach:
                Combine human operators (security personnel) with AI algorithms.
                Leverage the strengths of both:
                Human Expertise: Contextual understanding, intuition, and decision-making.
                AI Algorithms: Scalability, consistency, and pattern recognition.
